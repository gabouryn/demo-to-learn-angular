# My Demo App

This app was created to learn more about Angular and Observables from RxJS. 

What I've learned about/touched:
- Angular
    - routing: how setup basic page navigation
    - using components and HTML templates: creating and using different components
    - `ng-container`, `*ngFor`, `*ngIF`: control what elements appear on the page
    - a bit of Angular Service
    - `@Input`, `@Output`: how to pass data between parent and child components 
- Observables
    - creating an observable using `from` and using delays to stagger data transmission
    - subscribe to an event emitter and use `merge` to create a single observable to which I subscribe

Challenges:
- Most of the challenges came from formatting the page to make it look nice and have the elements you want appear where you want them (css and html)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.12.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
